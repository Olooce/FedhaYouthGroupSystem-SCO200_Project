## Package: **handlers**

In a real-world application, this package would typically handle API endpoints to enable interaction with various system components via HTTP requests. These API endpoints would facilitate communication between the front-end and back-end, manage user authentication, and handle data retrieval and updates.

However, due to the scope of this academic project and time constraints, the implementation of these API endpoints has not been included. Instead, the system's graphical user interface (GUI) has been tightly coupled within the same codebase as the core functionalities. This means that both the business logic and the user interface are intertwined in the same application, which simplifies development but may not follow best practices for large-scale software design.

In a production environment, it would be ideal to decouple the GUI from the core logic and introduce a full-fledged API layer. This would allow for better separation of concerns, improved maintainability, and the ability to integrate with other systems, mobile applications, or even to swap out the user interface without impacting the underlying system.
